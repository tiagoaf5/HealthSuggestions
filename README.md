# HealthSuggestions

A Chromeâ€™s extension to suggest additional query suggestions, in the three main search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo), related to Health. It provides lay and scientific terms related with the original query. Every user movement is logged and saved in a database so studies of use can be done later.

 - [**healthSuggestionsExtension**](healthSuggestionsExtension) - Contains the Google Chrome extension.
 - [**healthSuggestionsServer**](healthSuggestionsServer) - Server in Django that handles logging and suggestions.
